# matvec: Fun with matrices

Version 0.2.0.

This is a fancy calculator for matrices. We will be building it up over the following weeks.

## Building

Build the code from your terminal using:

```shell
g++ -o matvec matvec.cpp
```

## Running

Run the code by executing `./matvec` (no arguments expected).

In this version, the program will only execute its tests.

## Example output

```shell
$ ./matvec
Vector of size 3
[ 5 7 9  ]
Tests passed!
```
