# gcd: The greatest Greatest Common Divisor calculator

gcd computes the Greatest Common Divisor with different algorithms.

## Building

Build gcd in your terminal:

```shell
g++ -o gcd gcd.cpp
```

## Running

Run gcd in your terminal:

```shell
./gcd
```

No arguments are expected.

The numbers A and B to compute the GCD of are hard-coded in the beginning of the `main()` function.

## Example output

```shell
$ ./gcd 
gcdRec=4
gcdIter=4
gcdIter2=4
gcdIter3=4
a=8 b=12
c=-43 d=245
```
