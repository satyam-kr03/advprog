# Sortable: Who is the cutest penguin?

An exercise for the C++20 Concepts.

## Building

You need to use C++20 for this project. Build from your terminal using CMake:

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

In case you are calling g++ directly, then pass the `--std=c++20` option.

## Running

Run from your terminal with `./sortable`.

## Example output

```shell
$ ./sortable 
{ { 1 } { 3 } { 5 } }
```

## Notes

The skeleton will not compile: You first need to implement the `Sortable` concept.
