# Vec: A vector implementation

An exercise to try out C++ templates.

## Building

Build from your terminal:

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

## Running

Run with: `./vec`

## Example output

```shell
$ ./vec 
Test 1 OK
Test 2 OK
2
3
5
Test 3 OK
```

## Notes

The skeleton should give a compilation warning about something you need to implement. The tests should also fail when you run `vec`.
